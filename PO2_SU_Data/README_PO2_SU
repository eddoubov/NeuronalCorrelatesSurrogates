Description: PO2 and single unit data for all 43 resting state experiments and a single optogenetic experiment. The single unit data is smoothed and normalized in accordance with the Methodology descriped in manuscript. Data has been detrended to remove any potential slow drift.

File names: Filenames consist of "[experiment type]_exp[experiment number].csv". Experiment type is either "rs" (resting state) or "opto" (optogenetics). Experiment number denotes the unique number identifier for each distinct experiment per each experiment type. Ex: "opto_exp1" and "rs_exp1" denote two seperate experiments, one for optogenetics and the other for resting state data.

Data Format: The columns denote the time (in seconds), PO2 channel (A.u.), Single unit data (A.u.) for the first column, second column, and third column to the last column, respectively.
